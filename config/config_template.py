# SERIAL OUTPUT FORMAT CONFIGURATION
# ----------------------------------
# This dictionary defines how data is sent to the Arduino scoreboard over serial.
# The message sent will follow this format:
#   PREFIX + [fields] + SUFFIX
# Where:
#   - PREFIX is a string prepended to the message (e.g. "4,")
#   - SUFFIX is appended at the end (e.g. "#")
#   - PAD_CHAR is used to left-pad numeric values to fixed width (e.g. '-' -> "---")
#   - FIELDS is an ordered list of dictionaries. Each dictionary specifies:
#       - name: name of the field from the data
#       - widths: number of digits (field is left-padded to this length)

# Configuration for serial output formatting
# This defines what fields are sent to the Arduino scoreboard, in what order,
# how wide each field should be, and how to pad them.
# - Fields are taken from the dictionary passed to serial_mgr.send_score(data_dict)
# - If a field is missing or blank, it will be padded with the pad character
# - If "target" is 0, it will be shown as dashes (e.g. "---")
#
#
# Example configuration of all fields
# SERIAL_OUTPUT_FORMAT = {
#    "fields": ["batsa", "total", "batsb", "wickets", "overs", "target"],  # Order of fields to send

# }
#
#
# NOTE - this must match what your Arduino is expecting
#
# ack_enabled: True or False - determines if serial_manager will wait for the ACK from Arduino
#                              if no ACK received it will retry until it is received, or restart itself
#                              /serial_status endpoint reports serial status

# ACK handling requires the Arduino to be correctly configured to send back a correctly formatted ACK
# so default is to disable

# Overs per Innings Rules
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# These rules determine how many overs per innings to assign when a fixture
# is automatically selected (at startup on a new day).
#
# Logic:
# - The system reads today's fixture from fixtures.json
# - It checks the Match Type and Division/Cup values
# - Each rule is checked in order:
#     - If match_type matches exactly (case-insensitive), and
#     - If division_contains is blank or matches part of the division string
#   â†’ then the overs_per_innings value from that rule is applied
#
# Example:
# {
#     "match_type": "League",
#     "division_contains": "Division",
#     "overs": 40
# }
#
# You can also use a rule without division matching:
# {
#     "match_type": "Friendly",
#     "overs": 35
# }
#
# The first matching rule is applied.
